### **Snake Game on Arduino with LCD Display**  

This project implements the classic **Snake game** on an **Arduino**, using an **LCD display** for visual output. The snake moves across the screen in a pixel matrix, growing as it collects food while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen borders. The movements direction are controlled using buttons, providing an interactive experience on a small embedded system.  

**Technologies Used:** Arduino, LCD Display, Buttons, Embedded C++.
